## FTDI USB driver FILE
10.2  USB B connector communication

the byte stream uses the ASCII characters in the range 1..255 / 0x01..0xFF in hexadecimal

HEADER:
1 = "Start of Header" (<SOH>, 1,  0x01)
2 = counter (range "A" to "Z" overflow "Z" to "A")
3 = "N" => modelos HC30/60TS

## Humacount30TS
short idVendor = 0x0403;
short idProduct = 0x6001;

FOOTER:
```
checksum  two-digit hexadecimal summing values of all characters in the message header and body, including the beginning <SOT> and <ETX>, adding 255 (hex: 0xFF) to it, and keeping only the last two hexadecimal(!) digits
last character of a record "End of Transmission" (<EOT>, 4, 0x04)
The next record can start right after the <EOT> character
```
